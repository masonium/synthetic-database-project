# Project Charter - Synthetic Discharge Database v1


## Executive Summary
The plan is to create a publicly available database that contains synthetic (aka fake), yet representative patient-level inpatient records. 


## Project Goals
_**SMART**: **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**ttainable, **R**elevant, and **T**ime-bound_
- Develop a program to run Synthea to build a database (see bullet 2), and publish v1.0 release. (Lisa)
- Create a synthetic patient level database with 15,000 records, that matches CA inpatient hospital data submission specs and publicly available statistics for total discharges by sex and possibly hospital.
- Create a summary statistic workbook describing the database, to be published with the database. (Stef)
- Create and test a publicly available access point for database, and summary workbook (GitHub?)



## Deliverables
- A program that builds a database
- A synthetic database
- A summary statistic workbook
- An access portal or distribution channel for the database and summary workbook



## Business Case / Background
